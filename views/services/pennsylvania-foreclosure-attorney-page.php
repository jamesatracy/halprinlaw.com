	<h3>What to Do if You Receive a Foreclosure Letter</h3>

	<p>If you are behind on your mortgage payments and are in jeopardy of your home being foreclosed, contact HalprinLaw where we will explore and advise you on all available options to assist in saving your home.</p>

	<p>Our team will evaluate your unique situation and current financial obligations to determine how to most effectively handle your impending foreclosure or how to avoid foreclosure altogether.  It may be possible to renegotiate the terms of your loan with the lender, but it is also important to prepare for the possibility of defending against a foreclosure proceeding.</p>

	<p>HalprinLaw attorneys provide <strong>complete foreclosure defense services</strong>. We will review closely the terms of your mortgage and pursue every legal option available in order to stop, or at least delay, any foreclosure proceeding against you. Mounting a sound foreclosure defense can also allow you the necessary time to get your affairs in order or sell your home so you can keep the equity you've earned.</p>

	<p>HalprinLaw attorneys will review the foreclosure documents including all of the relevant loan documents and will advise you on possible foreclosure defenses and ways to avoid foreclosure.</p>
	<br/>
	<h3>Under certain circumstances, we can help stop foreclosure and protect your equity interest in property by:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Filing for bankruptcy</li>
		<li>Refinancing your mortgage</li>
		<li>Advertising and negotiating the sale of the property inside or outside of bankruptcy</li>
		<li>Negotiating with the mortgage company to avoid foreclosure</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Of course, not all of these options are appropriate for every situation.  As long as a Sheriff's sale has not been completed, you frequently will have an alternative to foreclosure. Sheriff's sales can even be reversed after the date of sale, if the deed has not yet been issued.</p>

	<p>As we have been doing for nearly 30 years, <strong>we provide customized solutions</strong> that meet the unique challenges each of our clients face.  Be comforted by knowing that foreclosure help is only a phone call away.</p>
	<p class="quote-box">"Before hiring HalprinLaw, I was completely overwhelmed. I was out of work for a while and was afraid I was going to lose my house. Michael was able to help me restructure my debt and work with my creditors to save my home. And he did this with a very reasonable expense to me. I'm completely relieved and VERY glad I hired HalprinLaw. They simply take care of everything and no one can touch their level of service or expertise."<br><br/><strong>Gina D., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
