	<h3>We Protect You from Unfair Debt Collection Practices and Creditor Harassment</h3>

	<p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA") is a federal law that was designed to <strong>protect you from abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collection practices</strong>. These laws protect consumers from debt collectors who engage in behavior that is abusive or harassing while attempting to collect a debt.</p>

	<p>The FDCPA provides rules for collection representatives and some lawyers in the manner in which they communicate, both verbally and orally, with debtors. Collectors in violation of the FDCPA may face harsh fines. If they have damaged your reputation, you may be entitled to compensation.</p>
	<br/>
	<h3>Abusive Debt Collectors Practices</h3>

	<p>Outstanding debt can create significant anxiety and uncertainty, leaving many individuals feeling helpless to regain control of their finances. There are many unfair debt collection practices. In particular, many consumers have problems with debt buyers. Debt buyers are companies which purchase debt from other companies and then try to collect those debts from consumers.</p>
	<br/>
	<h3>Common Violations of the FDCPA include:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Collectors asking you to pay more than the amount you owe.</li>
		<li>Contacting you at your place of employment when they have been informed&nbsp; your employer disapproves of these calls.</li>
		<li>Using obscene, profane, abusive, or threatening language.</li>
		<li>Calls that are repeated, continuous, before 8:00 am or after 9:00 pm.</li>
		<li>Collectors who threaten action they cannot or will not take. This action can include legal action, wage garnishment, or job loss.</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
