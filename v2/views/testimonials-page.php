	<p>Here are what just a few of our satisified clients are saying about working with HalprinLaw:</p>
	<br/>
	<h2>Bankruptcy</h2>
	<p class="quote-box">"My bills were so big I couldn't face them until I found HalprinLaw and a solution to my problem. I chose Michael Halprin as my bankruptcy lawyer and it was the best decision I've ever made. They did not judge me, they worked with me until my debt issues were under control and I could mange my financial life again. Now I can see the light at the end of the tunnel."<br><br/><strong>Terri C., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<p class="quote-box">"I would like to thank you for your support and help during a very difficult time for our family. Your professional expertise and kindness during the process was most appreciated and assuring. I am confident that because of your expert guidance and patience in explaining all the details to me that my bankruptcy case was the best decision for our family. Thank you."<br><br/><strong>Jamie &amp; Dean D., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<p class="quote-box">"WOW! That is all I can say about Michael Halprin and the team at HalprinLaw. It's so nice to know that my bankruptcy proceeding was handled efficiently and smoothly so I can focus on getting my life back in balance. I spoke to other attorneys before I chose to work with Michael. I felt I wasn't being heard, but Michael empathized and communicated in a way that really helped while going through this difficult time. He always returned my call promptly and was able to provide a long-term solution that worked for me and my family. That's why I absolutely LOVE Michael Halprin and the staff at HalprinLaw."<br><br/><strong>Eleanor K., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<p class="quote-box">"I had a complicated bankruptcy case that was very upsetting to everyone involved. You took care of all the details of filing Chapter 7 for me. I'm especially grateful that you treated me in the most compassionate way while paying attention to every important detail. Your follow through and constant reassurance until the case was completed took a load of worry off my shoulders. I will gladly refer you if ever a friend needs a great attorney."<br><br/><strong>Theresa M., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<p class="quote-box">"Michael, you are by far the best attorney I have ever come across. I am a simple man, from a military background. I had a very hard time finding a lawyer I was comfortable talking about my bankruptcy case with and that I felt was truly looking out for my best interest. Your patient explanation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy law to me and my options took away much of the stress I was feeling. You are very articulate and the kindness you showed me made all the difference in getting through this difficult decision."<br><br/><strong> Thomas B, Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<br/>
	<h2>Debt Collection</h2>
	<p class="quote-box">"Thank you all for all you have done for me. You walked me through the process of relieving my debt and dealing with my creditors and you were very compassionate during the process. Now I can have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!"<br><br/><strong>Della B., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<br/>
	<h2>Lawsuit Defense</h2>
	<p class="quote-box">"I cannot thank Michael and the staff at HalprinLaw enough for all the hard work you did in defending my lawsuit. You are one of the most considerate, understanding people I have met. Your knowledge of the law is impressive. I could not have asked for better attention to the details of my case and in the end you saved me a ton of money! I will happily refer you to anyone that needs a great attorney!"<br><br/><strong>Weeder K. Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<br/>
	<h2>Foreclosure</h2>
	<p class="quote-box">"Before hiring HalprinLaw, I was completely overwhelmed. I was out of work for a while and was afraid I was going to lose my house. Michael was able to help me restructure my debt and work with my creditors to save my home. And he did this with a very reasonable expense to me. I'm completely relieved and VERY glad I hired HalprinLaw. They simply take care of everything and no one can touch their level of service or expertise."<br><br/><strong>Gina D., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
	<p class="quote-box">"You saved my home and helped me restructure my debt and I am completely grateful to you! I am not the easiest person to deal with, especially when I had to make decisions on how to manage my debt, and save my home from foreclosure. You were so patient with me and the amount of time and energy you put in to my case and helping me understand everything was much more in depth than any other bankruptcy lawyer I spoke with. The prior 2 attorneys I interviewed did not even come close to your level of understanding and expertise. I cannot thank you enough!"<br><br/><strong>Patricia G., Philadelphia, PA</strong></p>
