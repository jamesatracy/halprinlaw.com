<p>Declaring Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be a wise decision for your financial situation and help if you are behind on your mortgage payments or have assets that you could lose by filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Often times, <strong>you can protect your property and obtain debt relief</strong> by filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Chapter 13 is a repayment plan.  It is a federal law designed to help single and married individuals (including business owners) repay a portion of their debts with dignity and peace of mind.  A plan for debt repayment is created by one of our Halprin Law attorneys and you, and then approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  Upon successful completion of the plan, the bankruptcy is discharged.</p>
<br/>
