	<p>Doctors and other health-care providers must follow certain standards when caring for patients. While a simple mistake does not constitute negligence, an injury or death caused by the failure to provide reasonable standards of care or the failure to diagnose a detectable condition may be considered malpractice.</p>

	<p>Upon accepting your case, <strong>HalprinLaw malpractice lawyers will aggressively investigate and pursue claims</strong> for catastrophic injuries and death arising from:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Birth Trauma</li>
		<li>Failure to Diagnose Cancer and Other Diseases</li>
		<li>Surgical Errors</li>
		<li>Anesthesia Injuries / Death</li>
		<li>Disfigurement</li>
		<li>Inappropriate or Dangerous Treatment Practices</li>
		<li>Pharmaceutical Injuries and Prescription Drug Errors</li>
		<li>Hospital and Insurance Claims</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Our experience allows us to help clients determine whether or not malpractice has occurred and, when justified, help them recover compensation for their injuries.</p>
	<br/>
	<h3>Nursing Home Abuse or Neglect</h3>
	<p>In addition to our medical malpractice practice, we also represent clients who are victims of nursing home abuse or neglect. The federal Nursing Home Reform Amendments of 1987 and corresponding state laws protect residents in nearly all nursing facilities.</p>

	<p>For residents who lack decision-making capacity, the resident's agent under a power of attorney for health care or another legal representative recognized by state law may exercise the resident's rights.</p>

	<p>Federal law requires that nursing homes meet strong basic standards for the quality of life of each resident and for the provision of services and activities. There are many specific rights guaranteed by federal and state law.</p>

	<p>If you notice any of the following signs of abuse, please contact our office immediately.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Malnutrition</li>
		<li>Dehydration</li>
		<li>Pressure Sores / Bed Sores</li>
		<li>Dry Skin</li>
		<li>Chapped Lips</li>
		<li>Unexplained Weight Loss</li>
		<li>Inability to Eat</li>
		<li>Infections</li>
		<li>Falls / Broken Bones</li>
		<li>Excessive Bruising</li>
		<li>Verbal Abuse</li>
		<li>Physical Abuse</li>
	</ul>
